# Currency calculator

This project is built through JavaScript, html, and CSS formatting.

External resources used:
Currency rate .xml obtained from Bank of Taiwan website.
https://rate.bot.com.tw/xrt

XML files are normally blocked by CORS policy, you'll get an error like the following:

Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'file:///C:/Users/heyux/Desktop/final/rate.xml' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, isolated-app, chrome-extension, chrome-untrusted, https, edge.
rate.xml:1 
demo.html:1 

Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FAILED
rate.xml:1

But running through Node.js localhost displays properly.
